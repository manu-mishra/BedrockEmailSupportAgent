![Detailed Implementation Diagram](documents/images/detailed_implementation.png "Detailed Implementation Diagram")

1. **Email Service**:
   - **Amazon Workmail**: Manages incoming and outgoing customer emails. When a customer sends an email, Amazon Workmail receives it and triggers the next component in the workflow.
2. **AI Powered Email Processing Engine**:
   - **Email Handler Lambda**: Triggered by Amazon Workmail upon the receipt of an email, acts as the intermediary that receives requests and passes it to the appropriate Agents for Bedrock.
   - **Agents for Amazon Bedrock**: These AI agents process the email content, apply decision-making logic, and draft email responses based on the customer's inquiry and relevant data accessed.
   - **Guardrails for Bedrock**: Ensure that all interactions conform to predefined standards and policies to maintain consistency and accuracy.
3. **Information Repository**:
   - **Knowledge Bases and Open Search**: The system indexes documents and files stored in Amazon S3 using Open Search for quick retrieval. These indexed documents provide a comprehensive base of knowledge that the AI agents consult to inform their responses.
4. **Business Applications**:
   - **Business APIs**: These are invoked by AI agents when specific transactions or updates need to be executed in response to a customer's request. The APIs ensure that all actions taken are appropriate and accurate as per the processed instructions.
5. **Amazon SES**:
   - After the response email is finalized by the AI agents, it is sent to Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) which then dispatches the response back to the customer, completing the interaction loop.

## Deployment Steps

To deploy the Generative AI-based email support system, follow these steps which guide you through setting up the necessary environment and deploying the infrastructure using AWS CDK.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions. You will also need Node.js and AWS CDK installed on your local machine.

### Installation
Clone the repository and begin by installing the necessary NPM packages. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
This command will install all dependencies defined in your package.json file, preparing your environment for deployment.

### Deploy the CDK project

Bootstrap CDK code to preview the resources that will be created:

```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

Next, synthesize the CloudFormation template from the CDK code to preview the resources that will be created:

```bash
cdk synth
```
This command generates the AWS CloudFormation template for ther application, allowing you to review the infrastructure that will be deployed.

Once you have reviewed the synthesized template and are ready to deploy, execute the following command:
